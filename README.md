# Statistical Learning Theory (2021 Spring) Course Projects

Repo dedicated to the 4 term projects for ETH Zurich Statistical Learning Theory course. The project topics are as follows:

**Project 1:** Gibbs sampling, Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm, MCMC sampling, Ising Model and Simulated Annealing implementations and their computational alleviations to tackle image denoising and travelling salesmen problems.

**Project 2:** Deterministic Annealing based clustering implementation and computational improvements for categorical classification task.

**Project 3:** Histogram Clustering implementation with different estimation variants to tackle image segmentation problem.

**Project 4:** Implementing the Constant Shift Embedding method to investigate the downstream dimension reduction and clustering based classification performance on the 'email-Eu-core network' data.

For further read and discussion on the topics, the related Jupyter Notebooks of each project contains markdowns and references for the used methods.
